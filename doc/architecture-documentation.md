# API Gateway Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

This API Gateway is designed as a high-performance proxy service that sits between clients and backend services, providing routing, security, and performance enhancement features. The system uses modern C++ with asynchronous I/O patterns to achieve high throughput and low latency.

## Core Components

### 1. Server Module

- **HttpServer**: Core HTTP/HTTPS listener built on Boost.Asio
- **WebSocketServer**: WebSocket support using WebSocket++
- **ConnectionPool**: Manages backend connections for reuse and efficiency

### 2. Request Processing Pipeline

- **RequestHandler**: Base abstract class for HTTP request processing
- **RouterHandler**: Implements dynamic routing logic
- **LoadBalancer**: Distributes requests among backend services
- **FailoverManager**: Handles backend service failures

### 3. Security Module

- **AuthMiddleware**: JWT token validation and session management
- **IpFilter**: Implements IP whitelisting/blacklisting
- **SslTerminator**: Handles SSL/TLS connections
- **CorsHandler**: Implements CORS policy enforcement

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **CompressionMiddleware**: Implements gzip compression
- **RateLimiter**: Redis-backed request rate limiting
- **CacheManager**: Response caching for improved performance

### 5. Monitoring & Observability

- **Logger**: Structured logging system
- **MetricsCollector**: Performance and health metrics gathering
- **HealthChecker**: System health monitoring

## Request Flow

1. Client request is received by HttpServer or WebSocketServer
2. Request is parsed by RequestHandler
3. Security middleware performs authentication and authorization
4. Router determines appropriate backend service
5. LoadBalancer selects specific backend instance
6. Request is proxied to backend with additional headers
7. Response is processed (compression, caching) and returned to client

## Design Patterns Used

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Request middleware pipeline
- **Factory Method**: Creating request and response handlers
- **Strategy**: Interchangeable load balancing algorithms
- **Observer**: Event system for monitoring and metrics
- **Singleton**: Configuration and logging services

## Concurrency Model

The gateway uses an asynchronous event-driven architecture with a thread pool:

- Main thread accepts connections
- Worker thread pool processes requests asynchronously
- Lock-free data structures for shared state where possible
- Strand pattern for sequential handler execution

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling to minimize TCP overhead
- Zero-copy buffer management for request/response data
- Move semantics to minimize data copying
- Custom memory pool for request objects

## Configuration System

The gateway uses a hierarchical configuration system:

- Static configuration via JSON/YAML files
- Dynamic configuration via admin API
- Redis-backed distributed configuration for cluster setups
