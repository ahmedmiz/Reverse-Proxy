# Design Decisions

This document outlines key architectural and implementation decisions made during the development of the API Gateway, including alternatives considered and justifications.

## 1. Choice of C++ and Framework Components

### Decision
Implemented the core system in C++17 with Boost.Asio for asynchronous networking.

### Alternatives Considered
- Golang with standard library
- Rust with Tokio
- Node.js/Express

### Justification
C++ with Boost.Asio provides:
- Superior performance with lower memory footprint
- Fine-grained control over memory management
- Custom threading model flexibility
- Mature libraries (Boost ecosystem, libcurl, WebSocket++)

## 2. Request Processing Architecture

### Decision
Implemented a middleware-based pipeline pattern with composable handlers.

### Alternatives Considered
- Single monolithic request processor
- Event-based pub/sub system
- Virtual function inheritance hierarchy

### Justification
The middleware pattern provides:
- Modular and composable processing stages
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier unit testing of individual components
- Simple extension points for new functionality

## 3. Authentication Implementation

### Decision
JWT-based authentication with Redis token storage.

### Alternatives Considered
- OAuth 2.0 server implementation
- Session-based authentication
- API key validation only

### Justification
JWT provides:
- Stateless operation for most requests
- Ability to encode permissions directly in tokens
- Standards-based implementation
- Integration with existing SSO solutions

## 4. Load Balancing Strategy

### Decision
Implemented weighted round-robin with health checking.

### Alternatives Considered
- Simple round-robin
- Least connections
- Consistent hashing
- Random selection

### Justification
Weighted round-robin with health checking:
- Respects varying capacity of backend servers
- Properly handles failed or degraded servers
- Maintains performance during partial outages
- Simple to implement and understand

## 5. WebSocket Handling

### Decision
Used WebSocket++ library with custom proxy logic.

### Alternatives Considered
- Boost.Beast WebSocket
- Implementing WebSocket protocol directly
- Using a separate service for WebSocket traffic

### Justification
WebSocket++ provides:
- Mature and well-tested implementation
- Compatible integration with Boost.Asio
- Full WebSocket protocol support with extensions
- Minimal overhead compared to alternatives

## 6. Memory Management Strategy

### Decision
Implemented custom memory pool with object recycling for request/response objects.

### Alternatives Considered
- Standard allocators
- Shared pointers for all objects
- Thread-local allocators

### Justification
Custom memory pool provides:
- Reduced memory fragmentation
- Better cache locality
- Minimized allocation overhead in request path
- Predictable performance under load

## 7. Configuration System

### Decision
Implemented a layered configuration system with file-based and dynamic options.

### Alternatives Considered
- Environment variables only
- Database-backed configuration
- Hardcoded config with compile-time options

### Justification
Layered configuration provides:
- Runtime reconfiguration without restarts
- Environment-specific overrides
- Default values with explicit overrides
- Centralized management for distributed deployments
